## Presentations

- **Leveraging mobility data for the automated calibration of travel demand models** <br/>_Gaurav Vyas, Bentley Systems._<br/>_Summary: Travel demand models whether 4-step or Agent-Based (ABMs) were traditionally based on special travel surveys such as Household Travel Surveys (HTS‚Äôs) that served as the main source for estimation of the model coefficients. Other types of data such as transit on-board surveys, traffic counts, transit ridership by line, etc., were primarily used for the model validation and possible adjustments of the coefficients. The presentation illustrates a new a new general approach where different types of data including HTS and big data, can be used in one systematic process of travel model calibration in an automated manner using the case studies from MAG Weekend ABM and Chattanooga Person Travel Demand model._

- **Enhancing CRT Modeling in WFRC TDM v9.2: Diagnosing and Correcting Station-Level Forecast Biases** <br/>_Bill Hereth, WFRC_<br/>_WF TDM v9.2 aims to improve CRT modeling, addressing major underestimation of Utah County boardings (-34%, Provo -90%) and overestimation in Davis County (+58%). Refinements include adjusting drive-access utility (RUNFACTOR = 2.5) and adding purpose/period ASCs by distance bins, which reduced CRT trip distance errors from -11%‚Äì-56% to -5%‚Äì-18%. While large in-vehicle time adjustments (60‚Äì75 minutes) aligned Provo boardings, they harmed model sensitivity. Findings will guide users on CRT limitations and support calibration with 2023 Household and Transit On-Board Survey data._ ([**Download link to presentation**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vms6dSRLROttmH4DlDV9_EON4AESysZSyNy2pfm9oYo){:target="\_blank"})
