		<strong>Current Employment:</strong> Transportation Planner at Avenue Consultants <br><br/>
		
        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> Iâ€™m interested in how travel demand modeling and forecasting can quickly evaluate a range of potential outcomes based on future transportation or land use options. And how these insights play an important role in guiding broader planning efforts and funding decisions. <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> One project that stands out is the I-90 Greens Ferry overpass project in Post Falls Idaho. I had the opportunity to spend time in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, working on VISUM models and forecasts while learning a new model platform and model space <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> GIS applications like ERSI or QGIS, legacy model scripts like cityx, and all of WFRC/MAG web apps <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Outdoor activities like jogging with my dog, hiking, biking and camping <br><br/>
