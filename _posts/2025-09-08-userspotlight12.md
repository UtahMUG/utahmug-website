        <strong>Education:</strong> M.S. Civil Engineering from BYU<br><br/>
		
		<strong>Current Employment:</strong> CEO and President of Insight Analytics <br><br/>
		
        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> There is always something new to learn and do, which keeps work fresh & exciting. <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> One of my first major contributions to the WF Travel Demand Model was revamping the Household Disaggregation model. I rewrote it in Cube Voyager, replacing the outdated software handoff and removing its reliance on files from previous runs. These changes made the model more transparent, easier to use, and much simpler to update. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> Spreadsheets were my best friend for most of my career, with ArcGIS a close second. Python has now become a powerful tool in the toolbox. <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Hiking, classic movies, traveling, and occasionally yard work. <br><br/>
