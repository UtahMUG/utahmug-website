        <strong>Education:</strong> Associates of Computer Science from SLCC<br><br/>
		
		<strong>Current Employment:</strong> Data Analyst with the UDOT Planning Analytic Team <br><br/>
		
        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> Data processing and validation. I enjoy taking a raw dataset and going through all the steps to transform it into information or tools that we can use to make informed transportation investment decisions. <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> The Capacity Project Prioritization Process. It is very fulfilling to watch a project go through the nomination process, get scored in our model, and then end up on a ranked list in front of the commission. Redesigning the workflow of the models over the summer has been very enjoyable. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> In person meetings with stakeholders. Python. <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Disc golf, kayaking, travelling, bad reality TV, and any time spent with my girlfriend and dog. <br><br/>
