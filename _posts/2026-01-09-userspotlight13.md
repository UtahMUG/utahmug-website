        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> Finding interesting applications of travel models to answer planning questions, especially when combined with other models or data sources. Digging into underlying data and assumptions. Thinking through the cost/benefit balance of adding complexity to models.<br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> I led modeling work for UDOT's Logan US89/91 study that wrapped up last year, where we used the CMPO regional model to evaluate off-corridor solutions to benefit Logan's Main Street and the broader system, and then built a VISUM mesoscopic model off the regional model to evaluate solutions in more detail. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> The WF vizTool! Good VM infrastructure. Good old ArcGIS and Excel. F&P's Forecasting Discipline Group. <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Rock climbing, skiing, hiking, cooking <br><br/>
