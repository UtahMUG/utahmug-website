## Presentations

- **An Analytical Framework to Assessing Network Connectivity, Vulnerability and Resilience: Lessons Learned from San Bernardino County** ([link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALbwSbpH3BnO0NyFKv21V5Q5_SgU77ek/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114966978052404666809&rtpof=true&sd=true))<br/>_Zeina Wafa, Cambridge Systematics._<br/>_Summary: The presentation describes the analytical framework developed for assessing network connectivity by calculating distance travel to exit an area or to access a shelter in the event of an emergency. The framework also calculates emergency response times from fire departments to impacted areas, identifying potential vulnerabilities and connectivity issues in the network. The framework also responds to legislative requirements of AB 747 and SB 99 by calculating average evacuation times by hazard scenario as well as identifying parcels vulnerable to being stranded in an emergency, respectively. Finally, the framework leverages the travel demand model to examine network resilience and determine areas that can benefit from redundancies to accommodate evacuation demand._

- **Under the Hood: Updates to the Utah Travel Demand Models** ([link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wy3xnU3EzSEoemtj6VbmY_wngr95Id0GKuf_zjfggZU/edit?usp=sharing))<br/>_Planning Agencies & RSG._ <br/>_The Cache MPO, Dixie MPO, WFRC, MAG, and UDOT are in the process to update all the travel demand models in the state to support the Regional Transportation Plans and Long Range Plan. This presentation will cover the changes in the models, which include all the inputs (TAZs, SE, networks, etc.), the travel behavior parameters (coming from the 2023 HTS), and various model components (commercial vehicles, long distance, recreation, etc.). This presentation would be more than just a quick update; it will provide more details on the changes and give the MUG members and opportunity to ask questions so they know what is coming for projects they may be working on or propose in the future. This will cover all the models in the state: statewide model, Wasatch Front, Cache, Dixie, Summit-Wasatch, and Iron._
