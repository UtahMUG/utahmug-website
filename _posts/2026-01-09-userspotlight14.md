        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> I find it fascinating how the various components of demand modeling come together, with each aspect interconnected and influencing overall demand. Working on it is intellectually stimulating, and I enjoy this process.<br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> For the 2023 LRP/RTP, only about 900 of 12,000 Utah Tech enrollment records had in-county addresses, making direct spatial representation unrealistic. I applied and validated an inverse distance decay approach to better reflect actual enrollment patterns, and enjoyed working through the data gaps to find a practical solution. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> NCHRP Report 716, Conferences such as MOMO, ODOT Training on travel demand modeling <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, hiking, trying new recipes and spending time with my boyfriend and family. I am also a dedicated practitioner of Kriya Yoga and Hatha Yoga. <br><br/>
