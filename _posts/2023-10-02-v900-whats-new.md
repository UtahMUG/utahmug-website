As stated in the document, the vast majority of the changes made to the WF TDM in version 9 represent refinements to prepare the model for use in developing MAG and WFRC’s 2023 Regional Transportation Plans. These refinements include:

 1. Updates to the traffic analysis zones
 2. Updates to the socioeconomic county control totals and TAZ-level forecasts
 3. Updates to the highway and transit input files to reflect the 2023-2050 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and 2023-2028 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) projects
 4. Updates to the parameters and input files to reflect the model’s new 2019 base year

Other changes made to the WF TDM were to improve the model’s capability and to perform regular maintenance of the model’s code base and processing.
