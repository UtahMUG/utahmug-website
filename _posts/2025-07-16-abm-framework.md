**WFRC, MAG, UDOT, and UTA** are gearing up for a multi-year project to **implement an Activity-based Model (ABM)** representation of regional household travel within the **Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model**. As a key step, the team, with contractor support from RSG, has put together an **[ABM Implementation Framework document](https://wfrc.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WFRC-Activity-Based-Model-Implementation-Framework-20250221.pdf){:target="_blank"}**.

The framework document lays out the **background, draft goals, data needs, recommendations**, and what might be anticipated in terms of **scope, schedule, cost, initial model product, and training**. It sets the stage for whatâ€™s ahead, which includes a likely alignment with the ActivitySim consortium-supported open source project.

**WFRC expects to kick off the consultant procurement process later in 2025.** More details will come at that time, and regular updates will follow as the (roughly) three-year project gets rolling.

**We invite you to check out the framework document found on WFRC's [Models and Forecasting](https://wfrc.utah.gov/programs/models-forecasting/){:target="_blank"} page to get an initial feel for our next major model enhancement project.**
