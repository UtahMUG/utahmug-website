I wanted to share some information about the **Modeling Mobility Conference (MoMo 2025)**, a new event that fills the current gap left by TRB’s **Tools of the Trade** and **Innovations in Travel Analysis and Planning** conferences. With TRB pausing sponsorship of these practitioner-focused events, MoMo was created to provide a dedicated space for transportation modelers, planners, and data analysts to connect, share insights, and advance analytical tools for real-world decision-making.

The first MoMo conference will take place **September 14-17, 2025**, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the **McNamara Alumni Center, University of Minnesota**. Organized by a volunteer-led planning committee and sponsored by the **Zephyr Foundation**, the conference will feature sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities aimed at supporting the modeling community.

For more details, including updates on the call for **abstracts (due by February 21)** and for future registration information, visit [ModelingMobility.org](https://modelingmobility.org){:target="_blank"}.
