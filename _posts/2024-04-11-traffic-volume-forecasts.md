Official Cache County and WFRC area roadway volume forecasts can now be found on the new statewide web map at [https://unifiedplan.org/traffic-volume-map/](https://unifiedplan.org/traffic-volume-map/){:target="_blank"}. This new website will host the forecasts for all agencies statewide.

WFRC forecasts corresponding to the 2023 RTP were released on February 28, 2024. Cache County forecasts were released on April 10, 2024. Additional areas will be added as they are available.

The roadway forecasts are available for each phase of the respective transportation plans: 2032, 2042, and 2050, as well as a base year 2023 forecast and a Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) year 2028.

A future version of the map will include a view of socioeconomic and project data similar to the previous map.
