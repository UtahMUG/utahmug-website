Version 9.1.0 also reflects model script changes that support a custom-built standalone visualization tool (vizTool) for travel model data. In addition, the inclusion of a contained Python environment within the model as well as other Python related changes are highlighted in version 9.1.0. Other individual model processes were updated. Further details can be found in the What's New Document.

Have a very spooky day! Happy Halloween.
