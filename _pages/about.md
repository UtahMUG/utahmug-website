## Vision
As travel demand model users and colleagues in local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, transportation agencies, consultant firms, and educational institutions, we work together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and collaboration to inform, improve, and promote the science, art, and application of travel demand forecasting throughout the state of Utah.

As the Utah Model Users Group (MUG), we operate independently from, but in partnership with, the Interagency Modeling Technical Committee (IMTC) and Interagency Modeling Policy Committee (IMPC).

## Objectives and Goals

**We benefit from the knowledge and experience of all users and conduct our pursuits in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration.**

- We support the MUG Steering Committee with representation from a wide range of user types to guide the functions of the group.
- We employ a rotating representation of subject matter and geography in all our meetings.
- We hold a general meeting at least once per quarter and other topic-specific meetings as needed.

**We inform each other on developments, activities, best practices, and innovations in models and tools.**

- We maintain an open digital archive of model reference information and tools, including best practices and current model development efforts.
- We regularly inform each other regarding the actions and directions of the respective projects and committees in which we are involved.
- We highlight a unique development or application at each quarterly meeting that is also shared via digital communication and a future website.

**We improve the models, tools, and practice of travel demand forecasting.**

- We maintain and advocate for a prioritized list of user-identified research and improvement needs in models, methods, tools, and user skills.
- We facilitate broader discussion and collaboration on model and travel forecasting improvements through the use of a digital peer exchange platform.
- We foster mentorship amongst our members by connecting those with varied levels of experience and expertise.

**We promote the field and practitioners of travel demand forecasting to grow the reach and depth of our industry.**

- We share information for model and tool applications and innovations that have broader impact with those beyond our group.
- We highlight all types of users with a ‘User of the Quarter’ series via digital communication and a future website.
- We forward presentation ideas to other conferences, such as the Utah ITE Annual Conference and the Utah Transportation Conference.
